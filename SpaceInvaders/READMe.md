I worked on this project with a partner, so I do not take full credit for its creation. I was in charge of the screen and the graphics and the movements, so those are what I take credit for writing. He wrote the score keeping, health, and projectile methods and classes. This was a simple game we made together for our final assignment. It's supposed to mimic the classic game Space Invaders.
